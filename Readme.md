## 📌 About the Project
This project is focused on building a Machine Learning model to **[insert problem statement here – e.g., predict customer churn, classify loan defaults, etc.]** using **[Supervised/Unsupervised] Learning** techniques. The model aims to deliver reliable and interpretable predictions to assist in real-world decision-making.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The challenge is to develop a model that can effectively predict **[target variable]** from input features such as **[feature 1, feature 2, ...]**. The solution helps in **[impact – cost reduction, risk minimization, business growth, etc.]**.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- 📥 **Data Collection**: Gathered from **[source e.g., Kaggle, UCI, custom API]**.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Found patterns, correlations, and anomalies.
- 🧹 **Feature Engineering**: Transformed and cleaned the dataset.
- 🤖 **Modeling**: Tried different ML models like **Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.**
- 🔧 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied Grid Search / Randomized Search.
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Source**: [Insert data source]
- **Total Records**: `xxxx`
- **Features**:
  - `feature_1`: [description]
  - `feature_2`: [description]
  - ...
- **Target Column**: `target_column`

---

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values via **[drop / imputation]**.
- Scaled numerical features using **[StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler]**.
- Encoded categorical columns using **[OneHotEncoding / LabelEncoding]**.
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20)**.

---

## 🏗 Model Architecture
- Tried multiple algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
